## 2. Model Overview

This model forecasts a radical transformation of the Western transportation market over the next 15 years, driven by Tesla's autonomous vehicle technology. The lifecycle is divided into three distinct phases:

### 2.1 Phase 1: Disruption and Early Monopoly (2026–2029)

In this initial period, Tesla leverages its first-mover advantage and existing fleet hardware (HW3/HW4). While initial earnings are negative due to R&D and regulatory setup costs, rapid regulatory approval in the U.S. allows for "explosive" scaling.

**Key Drivers:**
- High pricing power (PPM of $1.20+) due to a lack of viable competitors
- Waymo's higher cost basis (~$0.99/mile vs Tesla's ~$0.59/mile) limits their scaling
- Nvidia-powered competitors still ramping production
- Tesla can activate existing consumer vehicles via software updates (see [Appendix A.7](#a7-fleet-sizing-and-activation-strategy))

**Valuation Logic:** Market Cap is driven by high P/E multiples (50-60x) that value future growth potential. The 2026 valuation includes the legacy EV and Energy business floor.

**Revenue Calculation:** 57,000 vehicles × 72,000 miles/year × $2.00/mile = $8.2B (see [Appendix A.2](#a2-utilization-rate-72000-milesyear))

### 2.2 Phase 2: The "Harvest" and Peak Valuation (2030–2035)

This is the golden age of the robotaxi model. Tesla achieves massive scale (31M+ vehicles) while maintaining high margins (28–40%). The Enterprise Value peaks as maximum profitability and growth intersect.

**Key Drivers:**
- Rapid accumulation of retained earnings ($2.43T by 2035)
- This massive cash pile becomes a significant component of the total Market Cap
- Fleet scales to 30M+ vehicles while margins remain historically high
- Competitors (Nvidia Bloc) still ramping; Tesla maintains pricing power

**Valuation Logic:** The market cap exceeds $8 Trillion. Earnings peak around $400B annually during this window. P/E multiples compress from 25x to 15x as the market recognizes the "terminal growth rate" is slowing—investors treat these years as a "cash cow" period.

**The "Earnings Peak" Rationale:** Tesla's highest earnings occur before the market fully matures. During this "monopoly harvest," Tesla leverages its massive pre-existing fleet while competitors are still ramping production.

### 2.3 Phase 3: Maturity and Commoditization (2036–2040)

Competition from the "Nvidia Bloc" and Zoox saturates the market. The industry stabilizes into an oligopoly (3-4 major players).

**Key Drivers:**
- Price wars drive the price per mile down to the $0.45 operational floor
- Tesla's margin compresses to a stable 15%
- Total VMT reaches 70% penetration, enabled by infrastructure efficiencies like platooning (see [Appendix A.6](#a6-traffic-density-and-platooning))
- The "Nvidia Bloc" has commoditized the software stack

**Valuation Logic:** P/E multiples compress to "utility" levels (15x) as growth slows. The Enterprise Value shrinks, but the Market Cap remains high (~$6.1T) due to the accumulated cash. Tesla becomes a utility giant—essentially a "Cash Cow Utility" that earns a stable $161B/year (like a super-sized version of Apple or Exxon) and sits on the largest cash reserve in human history.

**Capital Allocation Note:** In a real-world scenario, by the 2032–2035 window, Tesla would likely initiate massive stock buybacks or dividends, as it would be physically impossible to reinvest $400B+ in annual earnings back into the business once the fleet reaches 30M+ vehicles.

### 2.4 The Valuation Framework: EV + Retained Earnings

The valuation methodology separates the company into two components:

1. **Enterprise Value (EV):** The "P/E × Earnings" calculation. This represents what the market thinks the robotaxi "engine" is worth based on its future NPV.

2. **Retained Earnings:** The cumulative cash sitting on the balance sheet.

3. **Market Cap = EV + Retained Earnings:** This is the total price to buy the whole company (the business + the bank account).

This approach mitigates the "valuation whiplash" that would occur if pure P/E multiples were applied without accounting for the massive cash accumulation.

### 2.5 The Financial Calculation Formula

For each year:

1. **Total Miles Traveled (Tesla):** (Fleet Size US + Fleet Size EU + Fleet Size Other) × 72,000 miles/year
2. **Tesla Revenue:** Total Miles Traveled (Tesla) × Price per Mile
3. **Tesla Earnings:** Tesla Revenue × Profit Margin
4. **Enterprise Value:** Tesla Earnings × P/E Multiple
5. **Retained Earnings:** Previous Year Retained Earnings + Current Year Earnings
6. **Market Cap:** Enterprise Value + Retained Earnings

## 3. Competitive Landscape

### 3.1 The "3.5 Player" Western Market Split

In the mature 2040 market, the Western robotaxi industry consolidates into an oligopoly:

| Position | Player | Description | Estimated Share |
|----------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Tesla** | The Vertical Leader—owns hardware, software, manufacturing | ~1/3.5 (~29%) |
| 2 | **The Nvidia Bloc** | Mercedes, Hyundai, etc., sharing a common AI "brain" | ~1/3.5 (~29%) |
| 3 | **Amazon/Zoox** | The Logistics Leader—leveraging Amazon's delivery network | ~1/3.5 (~29%) |
| 4 | **Waymo/Google** | The "Luxury/Niche" or 0.5 share—squeezed by lower-cost vision-only players | ~0.5/3.5 (~14%) |

### 3.2 The "Tesla Spread" (15% vs. 5% Margin)

The core thesis is that Tesla maintains a structural cost advantage:

| Player | Cost/Mile (Est.) | Market Price/Mile | Margin | Long-Term Viability |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|--------|---------------------|
| Tesla | $0.20–$0.25 | $0.50 | 15%+ | Strong Survivor |
| Competitor A (Nvidia Bloc) | $0.35–$0.40 | $0.50 | ~10% | Sustainable |
| Competitor B (Waymo/Zoox) | $0.45–$0.48 | $0.50 | ~5% | Vulnerable/Niche |

**Why the Spread Exists:**
- Tesla provides its own hardware (zero markup)
- An automaker using Nvidia must pay a license fee ($2,500–$5,000 per car or a per-mile royalty)
- Tesla's "Unboxed" manufacturing process targets sub-$20k vehicle cost
- A Mercedes or Volvo using Nvidia chips has higher manufacturing costs

### 3.3 Geographic Market Split

| Region | Dominant Players | Protectionist Level |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Western (US/EU)** | Tesla, Waymo, Zoox, Nvidia Bloc | High (blocks Chinese firms) |
| **Eastern (China/APAC)** | BYD/Didi, Baidu, WeRide, Pony.ai | High (blocks Western firms) |

The model assumes Tesla has zero penetration in Asia due to protectionist policies, and the Asian market is assumed to balance out Western regulatory blocks on Chinese firms.

---

## 4. Appendix: Detailed Assumptions

Each assumption below includes the rationale and countervailing views.

---

### A.1 Geographic Scope: Western Markets Only

#### Model Assumptions
The model exclusively covers the Western Hemisphere (US, EU, and Other non-Asian markets), assuming zero penetration for Tesla in Asia due to protectionist policies.

- **US Market:** Tesla expects to roll out unsupervised ride-hailing to more than 30 U.S. cities in 2026
- **EU Market:** More cautious regulatory environment; the Dutch regulator RDW has a February 2026 target to review Tesla's FSD Supervised system
- **China/APAC:** Blocked due to data-security laws, trade barriers, and government support for domestic champions (Baidu, BYD, WeRide)

The Asian market is assumed to develop its own ecosystem with domestic players (Baidu Apollo Go, Pony.ai, WeRide) dominating.

#### Alternative Views
- **Potential EU Delays:** Full "unsupervised" robotaxi approval in Europe is likely years away due to strict UN-R-171 and EU Article 39 regulations. The EU market ramp may be significantly slower than modeled.
- **Chinese "Trojan Horse" Strategy:** Some Chinese firms like Pony.ai or WeRide have attempted to enter Western markets through partnerships (e.g., integrating into Uber's platform in the Middle East). If successful, this could add competitive pressure.
- **Tesla in China Risk:** Tesla's existing China operations could face additional restrictions, affecting their manufacturing base even for Western-bound vehicles.

---

### A.2 Utilization Rate: 72,000 Miles/Year

#### Model Assumptions
A constant high-utilization rate of 72,000 miles per year per vehicle is used throughout the timeline, based on NYC taxi benchmarks:

**NYC Taxi Baseline Data (2026):**
- Per 12-hour shift: ~290 km (180 miles)
- Daily average (double-shifted medallion taxi): ~312 km (194 miles)
- Annual mileage: ~112,000 km (70,000 miles) for a human-driven double-shift taxi
- Average trip distance: ~4.5 km (2.8 miles)
- Average speed in city traffic: 16–22 km/h (10–14 mph)

**Robotaxi Efficiency Gains:**
- Reclaims time lost to driver handoffs and breaks
- Estimated monthly mileage: 5,800–6,200 miles (vs. 5,833 for human drivers)
- Annual target: 72,000–75,000 miles
- "Deadhead" (empty) mile rates estimated at just 8%, compared to over 40% for traditional cabs

**Vehicle Lifespan:** While consumer Teslas are built for 300,000 miles, robotaxis are being projected for a 1 million mile operational life to handle these extreme cycles.

#### Alternative Views
- **Urban Speed Limits:** The primary cap on mileage is not the battery or AI, but traffic. With an average speed of 16 mph, even a vehicle active for 20 hours/day is limited to ~320 miles daily maximum.
- **Charging Downtime:** Even with optimized charging during deadhead periods, charging time reduces active hours.
- **Early Testing Data:** Some 2026 pilot programs report utilization as low as 20 miles/day during early testing phases.
- **Geographic Variation:** The 72,000 mile assumption is based on NYC—suburban or lower-density markets may have significantly lower utilization.

---

### A.3 Price per Mile Trajectory ($2.00 → $0.45)

#### Model Assumptions
The pricing glide follows a predictable decay curve driven by competition:

| Year | PPM | Rationale |
|------|-----|-----------|
| 2026 | $2.00 | Premium pricing during early rollout; mirrors current premium ride-hailing |
| 2029 | $1.20 | Scale achieved; still significant pricing power |
| 2032 | $0.85 | Competition ramping; prices compress |
| 2035 | $0.65 | Market maturing; aggressive price wars begin |
| 2038 | $0.52 | Near-floor pricing |
| 2040 | $0.45 | Operational floor—cannot go lower and maintain 15% margin |

**The $0.50 Paradigm Shift:**
At $0.50/mile, robotaxis move from "taxi replacement" to "car ownership replacement":
- Personal vehicle TCO: $0.70–$1.10/mile (including insurance, fuel, maintenance, depreciation)
- A service priced 30–50% lower than car ownership converts a substantial portion of personal vehicle miles into ride-hail miles
- This triggers "induced demand"—people travel more frequently for trips they might have previously walked or skipped

#### Alternative Views
- **Price Floor May Be Higher:** If regulatory costs (insurance, remote operators, safety validation) are higher than modeled, the floor may be $0.60–$0.70/mile.
- **Slower Price Decay:** Competition may take longer to materialize, allowing Tesla to maintain $1.00+ pricing into the 2030s.
- **Regional Pricing Variation:** Dense urban markets may command premium pricing indefinitely; the "floor" may only apply to suburban routes.
- **Surge Pricing:** Dynamic pricing during peak demand could maintain higher effective PPM than the table suggests.

---

### A.4 Tesla's Cost Advantage ($0.20–$0.25/mile)

#### Model Assumptions
Tesla maintains a permanent cost advantage due to vertical integration:

**Tesla's Cost Structure:**
- Electricity: ~$0.03–$0.05/mile (at 4 miles/kWh and $0.12–$0.20/kWh)
- Maintenance: ~$0.02–$0.03/mile
- Depreciation: ~$0.08–$0.10/mile (based on 1M mile lifespan and sub-$25k vehicle cost)
- Insurance/Admin: ~$0.05–$0.08/mile
- **Total: $0.20–$0.25/mile**

**Competitor Cost Structure:**
- Must pay Nvidia license fees ($2,500–$5,000/car or per-mile royalty)
- Higher manufacturing costs (no "Unboxed" process)
- More expensive sensor suites (LiDAR vs. vision-only)
- **Total: $0.35–$0.45/mile**

**The Structural Advantage:**
This spread is the engine for Tesla's long-term 15% margin. When the market price hits $0.50/mile:
- Competitors operate at 5% margin (barely surviving)
- Tesla maintains 15%+ margin (thriving)

This dynamic is precisely what forces competitors out of the market and consolidates the oligopoly.

#### Alternative Views
- **Nvidia Cost Reduction:** As Nvidia scales, their license fees may drop significantly, closing the cost gap.
- **Manufacturing Parity:** Legacy automakers may achieve manufacturing efficiency parity, especially for purpose-built robotaxis.
- **Tesla's Sensor Costs:** If Tesla is forced to add LiDAR or redundant sensors for regulatory approval, their cost advantage shrinks.
- **Hidden Costs:** The model may underestimate "remote operator" costs (human monitors at 1 operator per 50–100 cars), which adds a labor cost floor.

---

### A.5 Profit Margin Trajectory (-5% → 15%)

#### Model Assumptions
The margin curve follows the competitive lifecycle:

| Phase | Years | Margin | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Launch | 2026 | -5% | R&D and regulatory setup costs exceed early revenue |
| Monopoly Harvest | 2027–2029 | 45–55% | High prices, low competition, massive operating leverage |
| Peak Harvest | 2030–2032 | 40% | Scale achieved; still dominant market position |
| Competition Entry | 2033–2035 | 28% | Nvidia Bloc scales; price wars begin |
| Mature Market | 2036–2038 | 18% | Market near saturation; competition intense |
| Utility Phase | 2039–2040 | 15% | Stable equilibrium; 3–4 player oligopoly |

**The 15% Long-Term Floor:**
This is based on competitive dynamics, not cost. The market price will always be above cost, but competition drives the price down to where only the lowest-cost producer (Tesla at 15%) thrives while competitors (at 5%) merely survive.

A 15% net margin in a mature, capital-intensive industry is considered a very healthy, sustainable return. A 5% margin suggests a business vulnerable to economic downturns.

#### Alternative Views
- **Margin Compression Faster:** If the Nvidia Bloc scales faster than expected, margins could compress to 15% by 2030–2032.
- **Margin Floor Higher:** Network effects (where the fleet with shortest wait times dominates) could limit the market to 3–4 players earlier, maintaining 20%+ margins.
- **Margin Floor Lower:** A "race to the bottom" could drive margins below 15% if a deep-pocketed competitor (Amazon/Zoox) chooses to subsidize rides.
- **Regulatory Costs:** Mandatory insurance, safety validation, and remote operator requirements could add fixed costs that reduce margins.

---

### A.6 Traffic Density and Platooning

#### Model Assumptions
Automated 1–2 meter vehicle spacing mitigates traffic density issues, allowing infrastructure to absorb the massive 7.8 Trillion VMT at maturity.

**The "High-Throughput Autonomous Grid":**
- **Human-driven headway:** 15–30 meters between vehicles
- **Autonomous headway:** 1–2 meters (millisecond reaction times vs. 1.5 second human reaction)
- **Capacity increase:** 2.5x–10x lane capacity with 100% autonomous vehicles
- **Platooning benefits:** Reduced aerodynamic drag (up to 10% energy efficiency gain), more vehicles per lane-mile

**Lane Capacity Comparison:**
| Metric | Human-Driven | Autonomous |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Space between cars | 15–30 meters | 1–2 meters |
| Lane capacity | ~2,000 vehicles/hr | ~6,000+ vehicles/hr |
| Average speed in city | 10–14 mph | 15–20 mph (smoother flow) |

**The Revenue Balancing Effect:**
While "price per mile" drops, "miles per hour" of the fleet increases. Cars complete more trips per shift because they're not stuck in human-induced stop-and-go waves.

#### Alternative Views
- **Mixed Traffic Bottleneck:** As long as human drivers remain on the road (likely for decades), safety buffers between AVs and human vehicles limit capacity gains.
- **100% Autonomous Requirement:** The 2.5x–10x capacity gains require 100% autonomous traffic. In a mixed environment, gains may be only 10–30%.
- **Infrastructure Lag:** Roads, intersections, and traffic signals may need significant upgrades to enable these gains.
- **Regulatory Limits:** Governments may mandate minimum following distances even for AVs, limiting the benefit.

---

### A.7 Fleet Sizing and Activation Strategy

#### Model Assumptions
Tesla's early fleet size is enabled by activating existing consumer vehicles via software updates:

**The "Millions of Vehicles" Leverage:**
- Tesla has 6+ million vehicles on the road globally
- Unlike Waymo (which must build/purchase every vehicle), Tesla can convert existing consumer fleet into distributed robotaxis
- The bottleneck is regulatory approval, not manufacturing
- Tesla expects "Unsupervised FSD" to clear regulatory hurdles across U.S. states progressively

**Fleet Ramp Model:**
- 2026: 57k vehicles (mostly new Cybercab production + early owner opt-ins)
- 2029: 3.15M vehicles (software updates to existing fleet + new production)
- 2032: 16.0M vehicles (mature owner network + dedicated fleet)
- 2035: 31.0M vehicles (near-peak deployment)
- 2040: 33.0M vehicles (slight decline due to market saturation)

**Ownership Model Split:**
The model primarily assumes a Tesla-owned fleet, but institutional models also include "third-party ownership" where Tesla takes a 40–80% "take rate" from independent owners who put their cars on the network.

#### Alternative Views
- **HW3 Limitations:** There is ongoing 2026 debate whether older HW3 vehicles will meet stringent "safety-fidelity" requirements for unsupervised operation. This could limit the usable fleet significantly.
- **Owner Opt-In Rates:** Consumer willingness to put their personal vehicles on the robotaxi network may be lower than assumed (wear and tear, liability concerns).
- **Manufacturing Bottleneck:** If the fleet is primarily Tesla-owned (not consumer vehicles), the Cybercab production ramp (targeted April 2026) becomes the constraint.
- **Safety Validation:** The limit is not how many cars Tesla can build, but how quickly they can prove to regulators that "unsupervised" safety metrics are significantly better than human drivers.

---

### A.8 Market Penetration (0.1% → 70%)

#### Model Assumptions
Robotaxis progressively capture private transportation miles:

| Year | % of Private Transport Miles | Rationale |
|------|------------------------------|-----------|
| 2026 | 0.1% | Pilot phase; regulatory constraints |
| 2029 | 4.3% | Rapid urban adoption post-approval |
| 2032 | 25.1% | Mainstream adoption; car ownership declining |
| 2035 | 63.0% | Majority of urban miles; suburban penetration |
| 2038 | 68.0% | Near-saturation of addressable market |
| 2040 | 70.0% | Mature equilibrium |

**The 70% Ceiling:**
- Some trips remain private-vehicle (rural areas, specialized needs)
- Some trips are replaced by public transit, walking, cycling
- The remaining 30% represents the "non-addressable" market

**Total VMT Expansion:**
By 2040, total Western VMT exceeds current baselines due to "induced demand":
- Elderly, children, and disabled gain independent mobility
- Low prices encourage more frequent trips
- Empty "positioning" miles (deadheading) add to total

#### Alternative Views
- **Slower Adoption:** Consumer habits and car ownership preferences may prove stickier than assumed.
- **Public Transit Resilience:** In some cities, public transit may compete effectively at the $0.45/mile floor.
- **Regulatory Slowdown:** Safety incidents could trigger regulatory backlash, slowing penetration.
- **Economic Cycles:** Recessions could delay fleet expansion and consumer adoption.

---

### A.9 P/E Multiple Compression (60x → 15x)

#### Model Assumptions
Valuation multiples compress as the business matures:

| Year | P/E | Rationale |
|------|-----|-----------|
| 2026 | 60x | High-growth tech disruptor; market prices future potential |
| 2029 | 25x | Growth materializing; still significant upside |
| 2032 | 18x | Peak earnings visible; terminal rate becoming clear |
| 2035 | 15x | Utility-like stability; cash cow phase |
| 2038 | 15x | Mature industry; predictable cash flows |
| 2040 | 15x | Industrial/utility giant valuation |

**The NPV-Smoothing Logic:**
Institutional investors looking at total Net Present Value (NPV) of multi-decade cash flow smooth their valuation multiples. The outsized profits of the 2030s are a finite "harvest" before commoditization—investors discount this back rather than applying hype-era multiples.

**The 15x Maturity Multiple:**
Aligned with industrial/utility giants (Union Pacific, modern energy conglomerates). At maturity, Tesla behaves like a stable dividend-payer with predictable earnings.

#### Alternative Views
- **Higher Terminal Multiple:** If Tesla maintains innovation leadership (Optimus robot, energy storage), the market may assign a higher terminal multiple (20x+).
- **Lower Peak Multiple:** Skepticism about execution could keep peak multiples lower (15–20x even during growth phase).
- **Market Irrationality:** Retail investor enthusiasm could maintain higher multiples longer than fundamentally justified.
- **Cash Deployment:** If Tesla deploys retained earnings into new growth areas (rather than buybacks), the market may assign higher growth multiples.

### A.10 Retained Earnings Calculation

#### Model Assumptions
Cumulative earnings starting from $40B in early 2026:

| Year | Annual Earnings | Cumulative Retained |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 2026 | -$0.4B | $39.6B |
| 2027 | ~$30B | ~$70B |
| 2028 | ~$75B | ~$145B |
| 2029 | $149.7B | $295B |
| 2030 | ~$250B | ~$545B |
| 2031 | ~$320B | ~$865B |
| 2032 | $391.7B | $1,215B |
| 2033 | ~$400B | ~$1,615B |
| 2034 | ~$405B | ~$2,020B |
| 2035 | $406.1B | $2,430B |
| 2036 | ~$350B | ~$2,780B |
| 2037 | ~$280B | ~$3,060B |
| 2038 | $232.3B | $3,290B |
| 2039 | ~$195B | ~$3,485B |
| 2040 | $161B | $3,680B |

**The Cash Fortress:**
By 2040, Tesla holds ~$3.68 Trillion in cash—the largest cash reserve in human history.

**Capital Allocation Reality:**
In practice, Tesla would return much of this to shareholders via buybacks or dividends. If they used that $3.6T to buy back half their shares, the stock price would continue rising even as total Market Cap stabilized.

#### Alternative Views
- **Reinvestment:** Tesla may deploy earnings into new ventures (Optimus, energy, space), reducing retained earnings but potentially increasing growth multiples.
- **Acquisitions:** A $3T+ war chest could fund transformative acquisitions that change the company's profile entirely.
- **Regulatory/Tax Changes:** Windfall taxes or regulatory actions could reduce earnings accumulation.
- **Shareholder Pressure:** Investors may demand capital return well before the $3T+ level, reducing retained earnings trajectory.

### A.11 Comparison to Institutional Analysts

#### Model Assumptions
This model aligns with "bull-case" institutional frameworks but is more aggressive than consensus:

| Metric | This Model (2029) | ARK Invest Bull Case | Morgan Stanley Base Case |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Fleet Size | 3.15M vehicles | ~1,000–1,500 launching "full-scale" | ~1,000 vehicles (2026) |
| Pricing | $1.20/mile | $0.59–$0.99/mile | Higher (not specified) |
| Profit Margin | 55% | ~50% EBITDA | Cautious |
| Utilization | 72,000 miles/yr | 46,800–100,000 miles/yr | Variable |

**Model Positioning:**
- More aggressive than Morgan Stanley's conservative view
- Aligned with ARK's optimism on Tesla's structural advantages
- Accounts for "software activation" of existing fleet (a key differentiator)

#### Alternative Views
- **Consensus is Right:** Morgan Stanley's 1,000-vehicle projection for 2026 and 1M by 2035 may prove accurate if regulatory approval is slower than Tesla bulls expect.
- **ARK is Wrong:** ARK's historical projections have often been too optimistic on timelines.
- **Black Swan Risk:** Safety incidents, regulatory crackdowns, or competitive breakthroughs could invalidate the entire model.
- **Execution Risk:** Tesla's ambitious targets have historically experienced delays (Cybertruck, Semi, FSD timeline).

### A.12 The Nvidia "Android" Factor

#### Model Assumptions
Nvidia positions itself as the "Intel Inside" for legacy automakers:

**Nvidia's Strategy:**
- Drive Orin/Thor chipsets provide a complete self-driving stack
- A legacy OEM can integrate Nvidia and launch a robotaxi for ~$30,000 (vs. Waymo's $150,000+)
- Because Nvidia owns the GPU clusters (H100/B200), they can train driving models faster than anyone except Tesla
- The "Omniverse" simulation allows billions of virtual miles to catch up to Tesla's real-world data

**The "Android" vs. "Apple" Model:**
- Tesla is Apple (closed, integrated)
- Nvidia is Android (open to all)
- This allows the "Nvidia-powered" fleet to scale across multiple brands simultaneously

**The Threat:**
By 2036–2040, the Nvidia Bloc may match Tesla's volume collectively, even if no single OEM does individually.

#### Alternative Views
- **Integration Challenges:** Legacy OEMs may struggle to integrate Nvidia software effectively, leading to delays and quality issues.
- **Margin Pressure:** Nvidia's license fees add cost, limiting OEM margins and their ability to compete on price.
- **Data Disadvantage:** Tesla's real-world data advantage (billions of miles) may prove insurmountable.
- **Waymo Resilience:** Waymo's safety record and brand trust may allow them to command premium pricing, avoiding the cost competition.

## 5. Key Risks and Sensitivities

### 5.1 Regulatory Risk
The model assumes progressive regulatory approval. A major safety incident could trigger backlash, slowing deployment by years.

### 5.2 Technology Risk
FSD must achieve and maintain superhuman safety metrics. Any regression could halt deployments.

### 5.3 Competitive Risk
Faster-than-expected scaling by Nvidia Bloc or Waymo could compress margins earlier.

### 5.4 Macroeconomic Risk
Recessions could slow fleet expansion and consumer adoption.

### 5.5 Geopolitical Risk
Trade tensions, data security laws, or protectionist policies could reshape market access.

## 6. Conclusion

This model represents the **ideal physical limit** of Tesla's robotaxi opportunity in Western markets. Key takeaways:

1. **Peak Market Cap of $8.5T** occurs around 2035, when maximum earnings intersect with still-elevated P/E multiples.

2. **The "Harvest Window" (2029–2035)** is the critical value-creation period, generating over $2 trillion in cumulative earnings.

3. **Maturity ($6.1T Market Cap)** reflects a utility-like business with stable 15% margins and $3.7T in retained cash.

4. **The Core Thesis:** Tesla's structural cost advantage ($0.20/mile vs. competitors' $0.35–$0.45/mile) enables it to thrive at price points where competitors merely survive.

5. **Key Uncertainties:** Regulatory timeline, HW3 fleet activation, and Nvidia Bloc scaling speed.
