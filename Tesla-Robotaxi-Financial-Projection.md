## 2. Model Overview

This model forecasts a radical transformation of the Western transportation market over the next 15 years, driven by Tesla's autonomous vehicle technology. The lifecycle is divided into three distinct phases:

### 2.1 Phase 1: Disruption and Early Monopoly (2026–2029)

In this initial period, Tesla leverages its first-mover advantage and existing fleet hardware (HW3/HW4). While initial earnings are negative due to R&D and regulatory setup costs, rapid regulatory approval in the U.S. allows for "explosive" scaling.

**Key Drivers:**
- High pricing power (PPM of $1.20+) due to a lack of viable competitors
- Waymo's higher cost basis (~$0.99/mile vs Tesla's ~$0.59/mile) limits their scaling
- Nvidia-powered competitors still ramping production
- Tesla can activate existing consumer vehicles via software updates (see [Appendix A.7](#a7-fleet-sizing-and-activation-strategy))

**Valuation Logic:** Market Cap is driven by high P/E multiples (50-60x) that value future growth potential. The 2026 valuation includes the legacy EV and Energy business floor.

**Revenue Calculation:** 57,000 vehicles × 72,000 miles/year × $2.00/mile = $8.2B (see [Appendix A.2](#a2-utilization-rate-72000-milesyear))

### 2.2 Phase 2: The "Harvest" and Peak Valuation (2030–2035)

This is the golden age of the robotaxi model. Tesla achieves massive scale (31M+ vehicles) while maintaining high margins (28–40%). The Enterprise Value peaks as maximum profitability and growth intersect.

**Key Drivers:**
- Rapid accumulation of retained earnings ($2.43T by 2035)
- This massive cash pile becomes a significant component of the total Market Cap
- Fleet scales to 30M+ vehicles while margins remain historically high
- Competitors (Nvidia Bloc) still ramping; Tesla maintains pricing power

**Valuation Logic:** The market cap exceeds $8 Trillion. Earnings peak around $400B annually during this window. P/E multiples compress from 25x to 15x as the market recognizes the "terminal growth rate" is slowing—investors treat these years as a "cash cow" period.

**The "Earnings Peak" Rationale:** Tesla's highest earnings occur before the market fully matures. During this "monopoly harvest," Tesla leverages its massive pre-existing fleet while competitors are still ramping production.

### 2.3 Phase 3: Maturity and Commoditization (2036–2040)

Competition from the "Nvidia Bloc" and Zoox saturates the market. The industry stabilizes into an oligopoly (3-4 major players).

**Key Drivers:**
- Price wars drive the price per mile down to the $0.45 operational floor
- Tesla's margin compresses to a stable 15%
- Total VMT reaches 70% penetration, enabled by infrastructure efficiencies like platooning (see [Appendix A.6](#a6-traffic-density-and-platooning))
- The "Nvidia Bloc" has commoditized the software stack

**Valuation Logic:** P/E multiples compress to "utility" levels (15x) as growth slows. The Enterprise Value shrinks, but the Market Cap remains high (~$6.1T) due to the accumulated cash. Tesla becomes a utility giant—essentially a "Cash Cow Utility" that earns a stable $161B/year (like a super-sized version of Apple or Exxon) and sits on the largest cash reserve in human history.

**Capital Allocation Note:** In a real-world scenario, by the 2032–2035 window, Tesla would likely initiate massive stock buybacks or dividends, as it would be physically impossible to reinvest $400B+ in annual earnings back into the business once the fleet reaches 30M+ vehicles.

### 2.4 The Valuation Framework: EV + Retained Earnings

The valuation methodology separates the company into two components:

1. **Enterprise Value (EV):** The "P/E × Earnings" calculation. This represents what the market thinks the robotaxi "engine" is worth based on its future NPV.

2. **Retained Earnings:** The cumulative cash sitting on the balance sheet.

3. **Market Cap = EV + Retained Earnings:** This is the total price to buy the whole company (the business + the bank account).

This approach mitigates the "valuation whiplash" that would occur if pure P/E multiples were applied without accounting for the massive cash accumulation.

### 2.5 The Financial Calculation Formula

For each year:

1. **Total Miles Traveled (Tesla):** (Fleet Size US + Fleet Size EU + Fleet Size Other) × 72,000 miles/year
2. **Tesla Revenue:** Total Miles Traveled (Tesla) × Price per Mile
3. **Tesla Earnings:** Tesla Revenue × Profit Margin
4. **Enterprise Value:** Tesla Earnings × P/E Multiple
5. **Retained Earnings:** Previous Year Retained Earnings + Current Year Earnings
6. **Market Cap:** Enterprise Value + Retained Earnings

## 3. Competitive Landscape

### 3.1 The "3.5 Player" Western Market Split

In the mature 2040 market, the Western robotaxi industry consolidates into an oligopoly:

| Position | Player | Description | Estimated Share |
|----------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Tesla** | The Vertical Leader—owns hardware, software, manufacturing | ~1/3.5 (~29%) |
| 2 | **The Nvidia Bloc** | Mercedes, Hyundai, etc., sharing a common AI "brain" | ~1/3.5 (~29%) |
| 3 | **Amazon/Zoox** | The Logistics Leader—leveraging Amazon's delivery network | ~1/3.5 (~29%) |
| 4 | **Waymo/Google** | The "Luxury/Niche" or 0.5 share—squeezed by lower-cost vision-only players | ~0.5/3.5 (~14%) |

### 3.2 The "Tesla Spread" (15% vs. 5% Margin)

The core thesis is that Tesla maintains a structural cost advantage:

| Player | Cost/Mile (Est.) | Market Price/Mile | Margin | Long-Term Viability |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|--------|---------------------|
| Tesla | $0.20–$0.25 | $0.50 | 15%+ | Strong Survivor |
| Competitor A (Nvidia Bloc) | $0.35–$0.40 | $0.50 | ~10% | Sustainable |
| Competitor B (Waymo/Zoox) | $0.45–$0.48 | $0.50 | ~5% | Vulnerable/Niche |

**Why the Spread Exists:**
- Tesla provides its own hardware (zero markup)
- An automaker using Nvidia must pay a license fee ($2,500–$5,000 per car or a per-mile royalty)
- Tesla's "Unboxed" manufacturing process targets sub-$20k vehicle cost
- A Mercedes or Volvo using Nvidia chips has higher manufacturing costs

### 3.3 Geographic Market Split

| Region | Dominant Players | Protectionist Level |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Western (US/EU)** | Tesla, Waymo, Zoox, Nvidia Bloc | High (blocks Chinese firms) |
| **Eastern (China/APAC)** | BYD/Didi, Baidu, WeRide, Pony.ai | High (blocks Western firms) |

The model assumes Tesla has zero penetration in Asia due to protectionist policies, and the Asian market is assumed to balance out Western regulatory blocks on Chinese firms.

---

## 4. Appendix: Detailed Assumptions

Each assumption below includes the rationale and countervailing views.

---

### A.1 Geographic Scope: Western Markets Only

#### Model Assumptions
The model exclusively covers the Western Hemisphere (US, EU, and Other non-Asian markets), assuming zero penetration for Tesla in Asia due to protectionist policies.

- **US Market:** Tesla expects to roll out unsupervised ride-hailing to more than 30 U.S. cities in 2026
- **EU Market:** More cautious regulatory environment; the Dutch regulator RDW has a February 2026 target to review Tesla's FSD Supervised system
- **China/APAC:** Blocked due to data-security laws, trade barriers, and government support for domestic champions (Baidu, BYD, WeRide)

The Asian market is assumed to develop its own ecosystem with domestic players (Baidu Apollo Go, Pony.ai, WeRide) dominating.

#### Alternative Views

| View | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Tesla in China Risk | Bear: High | China operations could face restrictions, affecting manufacturing for Western-bound vehicles |
| EU Regulatory Delays | Bear: Medium | UN-R-171 and EU Article 39 regulations may delay unsupervised approval by years |
| Chinese Market Entry | Bear: Low | Pony.ai/WeRide could enter Western markets via partnerships (e.g., Uber in Middle East) |

---

### A.2 Utilization Rate: 72,000 Miles/Year

#### Model Assumptions
A constant high-utilization rate of 72,000 miles per year per vehicle is used throughout the timeline, based on NYC taxi benchmarks:

**NYC Taxi Baseline Data (2026):**
- Per 12-hour shift: ~290 km (180 miles)
- Daily average (double-shifted medallion taxi): ~312 km (194 miles)
- Annual mileage: ~112,000 km (70,000 miles) for a human-driven double-shift taxi
- Average trip distance: ~4.5 km (2.8 miles)
- Average speed in city traffic: 16–22 km/h (10–14 mph)

**Robotaxi Efficiency Gains:**
- Reclaims time lost to driver handoffs and breaks
- Estimated monthly mileage: 5,800–6,200 miles (vs. 5,833 for human drivers)
- Annual target: 72,000–75,000 miles
- "Deadhead" (empty) mile rates estimated at just 8%, compared to over 40% for traditional cabs

**Vehicle Lifespan:** While consumer Teslas are built for 300,000 miles, robotaxis are being projected for a 1 million mile operational life to handle these extreme cycles.

#### Alternative Views

| View | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Early Testing Data | Bear: ~20 mi/day | 2026 pilot programs report utilization far below model assumptions |
| Geographic Variation | Bear: 40–60k mi/yr | Suburban/low-density markets may have significantly lower utilization than NYC |
| Charging Downtime | Bear: 65–70k mi/yr | Charging reduces active hours even with optimized deadhead scheduling |
| Urban Speed Limits | Bear: ~320 mi/day max | Traffic caps mileage at ~117k mi/yr theoretical maximum (20 hrs × 16 mph) |

---

### A.3 Price per Mile Trajectory ($2.00 → $0.45)

#### Model Assumptions
The pricing glide follows a predictable decay curve driven by competition:

| Year | PPM | Rationale |
|------|-----|-----------|
| 2026 | $2.00 | Premium pricing during early rollout; mirrors current premium ride-hailing |
| 2029 | $1.20 | Scale achieved; still significant pricing power |
| 2032 | $0.85 | Competition ramping; prices compress |
| 2035 | $0.65 | Market maturing; aggressive price wars begin |
| 2038 | $0.52 | Near-floor pricing |
| 2040 | $0.45 | Operational floor—cannot go lower and maintain 15% margin |

**The $0.50 Paradigm Shift:**
At $0.50/mile, robotaxis move from "taxi replacement" to "car ownership replacement":
- Personal vehicle TCO: $0.70–$1.10/mile (including insurance, fuel, maintenance, depreciation)
- A service priced 30–50% lower than car ownership converts a substantial portion of personal vehicle miles into ride-hail miles
- This triggers "induced demand"—people travel more frequently for trips they might have previously walked or skipped

#### Alternative Views

| View | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Slower Price Decay | Bull: $1.00+/mi into 2030s | Competition may lag, extending high-margin pricing window |
| Surge Pricing | Bull: +15–30% effective PPM | Dynamic pricing during peak demand raises blended revenue |
| Regional Premium Pricing | Bull: $0.60–$0.80/mi urban | Dense urban markets may sustain premium pricing indefinitely |
| Higher Price Floor | Bear: $0.60–$0.70/mi floor | Regulatory costs (insurance, remote ops) may exceed model |

---

### A.4 Tesla's Cost Advantage ($0.20–$0.25/mile)

#### Model Assumptions
Tesla maintains a permanent cost advantage due to vertical integration:

**Tesla's Cost Structure:**
- Electricity: ~$0.03–$0.05/mile (at 4 miles/kWh and $0.12–$0.20/kWh)
- Maintenance: ~$0.02–$0.03/mile
- Depreciation: ~$0.08–$0.10/mile (based on 1M mile lifespan and sub-$25k vehicle cost)
- Insurance/Admin: ~$0.05–$0.08/mile
- **Total: $0.20–$0.25/mile**

**Competitor Cost Structure:**
- Must pay Nvidia license fees ($2,500–$5,000/car or per-mile royalty)
- Higher manufacturing costs (no "Unboxed" process)
- More expensive sensor suites (LiDAR vs. vision-only)
- **Total: $0.35–$0.45/mile**

**The Structural Advantage:**
This spread is the engine for Tesla's long-term 15% margin. When the market price hits $0.50/mile:
- Competitors operate at 5% margin (barely surviving)
- Tesla maintains 15%+ margin (thriving)

This dynamic is precisely what forces competitors out of the market and consolidates the oligopoly.

#### Alternative Views

| View | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Tesla LiDAR Requirement | Bear: +$0.03–$0.05/mi | Regulators may mandate redundant sensors, shrinking cost advantage |
| Remote Operator Costs | Bear: +$0.02–$0.04/mi | Human monitors (1:50–100 ratio) add labor cost floor |
| Nvidia Cost Reduction | Bear: Competitors to $0.30/mi | Nvidia license fees may drop at scale, closing gap |
| Manufacturing Parity | Bear: Competitors to $0.32/mi | Legacy OEMs may achieve efficiency parity with purpose-built robotaxis |

---

### A.5 Profit Margin Trajectory (-5% → 15%)

#### Model Assumptions
The margin curve follows the competitive lifecycle:

| Phase | Years | Margin | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Launch | 2026 | -5% | R&D and regulatory setup costs exceed early revenue |
| Monopoly Harvest | 2027–2029 | 45–55% | High prices, low competition, massive operating leverage |
| Peak Harvest | 2030–2032 | 40% | Scale achieved; still dominant market position |
| Competition Entry | 2033–2035 | 28% | Nvidia Bloc scales; price wars begin |
| Mature Market | 2036–2038 | 18% | Market near saturation; competition intense |
| Utility Phase | 2039–2040 | 15% | Stable equilibrium; 3–4 player oligopoly |

**The 15% Long-Term Floor:**
This is based on competitive dynamics, not cost. The market price will always be above cost, but competition drives the price down to where only the lowest-cost producer (Tesla at 15%) thrives while competitors (at 5%) merely survive.

A 15% net margin in a mature, capital-intensive industry is considered a very healthy, sustainable return. A 5% margin suggests a business vulnerable to economic downturns.

#### Alternative Views

| View | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Network Effects | Bull: 20%+ terminal margin | Fleet with shortest wait times dominates; 3–4 player limit maintains pricing |
| Faster Margin Compression | Bear: 15% by 2030–2032 | Nvidia Bloc scales faster than expected |
| Amazon Subsidization | Bear: <15% margin | Deep-pocketed competitor (Amazon/Zoox) may subsidize rides |
| Regulatory Cost Burden | Bear: -2–5% margin | Mandatory insurance, safety validation, remote ops add fixed costs |

---

### A.6 Traffic Density and Platooning

#### Model Assumptions
Automated 1–2 meter vehicle spacing mitigates traffic density issues, allowing infrastructure to absorb the massive 7.8 Trillion VMT at maturity.

**The "High-Throughput Autonomous Grid":**
- **Human-driven headway:** 15–30 meters between vehicles
- **Autonomous headway:** 1–2 meters (millisecond reaction times vs. 1.5 second human reaction)
- **Capacity increase:** 2.5x–10x lane capacity with 100% autonomous vehicles
- **Platooning benefits:** Reduced aerodynamic drag (up to 10% energy efficiency gain), more vehicles per lane-mile

**Lane Capacity Comparison:**
| Metric | Human-Driven | Autonomous |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Space between cars | 15–30 meters | 1–2 meters |
| Lane capacity | ~2,000 vehicles/hr | ~6,000+ vehicles/hr |
| Average speed in city | 10–14 mph | 15–20 mph (smoother flow) |

**The Revenue Balancing Effect:**
While "price per mile" drops, "miles per hour" of the fleet increases. Cars complete more trips per shift because they're not stuck in human-induced stop-and-go waves.

#### Alternative Views

| View | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Mixed Traffic Reality | Bear: 10–30% capacity gain | Human drivers on road for decades limit AV capacity benefits |
| 100% AV Requirement | Bear: 1.1–1.3x vs 2.5–10x | Full capacity gains require 100% autonomous traffic |
| Infrastructure Lag | Bear: Delayed gains | Roads, signals need upgrades before platooning benefits materialize |
| Regulatory Following Distance | Bear: 5–10m mandated | Governments may mandate minimum distances even for AVs |

### A.7 Fleet Sizing and Activation Strategy

#### Model Assumptions
Tesla's early fleet size is enabled by activating existing consumer vehicles via software updates:

**The "Millions of Vehicles" Leverage:**
- Tesla has 6+ million vehicles on the road globally
- Unlike Waymo (which must build/purchase every vehicle), Tesla can convert existing consumer fleet into distributed robotaxis
- The bottleneck is regulatory approval, not manufacturing
- Tesla expects "Unsupervised FSD" to clear regulatory hurdles across U.S. states progressively

**Fleet Ramp Model:**
- 2026: 57k vehicles (mostly new Cybercab production + early owner opt-ins)
- 2029: 3.15M vehicles (software updates to existing fleet + new production)
- 2032: 16.0M vehicles (mature owner network + dedicated fleet)
- 2035: 31.0M vehicles (near-peak deployment)
- 2040: 33.0M vehicles (slight decline due to market saturation)

**Ownership Model Split:**
The model primarily assumes a Tesla-owned fleet, but institutional models also include "third-party ownership" where Tesla takes a 40–80% "take rate" from independent owners who put their cars on the network.

#### Alternative Views

| View | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| HW3 Exclusion | Bear: -3–4M vehicles | HW3 may fail "safety-fidelity" requirements for unsupervised operation |
| Low Owner Opt-In | Bear: 20–40% participation | Wear/tear and liability concerns reduce consumer fleet availability |
| Cybercab Production Delay | Bear: 6–12 month slip | April 2026 production ramp becomes constraint if Tesla-owned fleet |
| Safety Validation Pace | Bear: Slower ramp | Regulatory proof of superhuman safety limits deployment speed |

### A.8 Market Penetration (0.1% → 70%)

#### Model Assumptions
Robotaxis progressively capture private transportation miles:

| Year | % of Private Transport Miles | Rationale |
|------|------------------------------|-----------|
| 2026 | 0.1% | Pilot phase; regulatory constraints |
| 2029 | 4.3% | Rapid urban adoption post-approval |
| 2032 | 25.1% | Mainstream adoption; car ownership declining |
| 2035 | 63.0% | Majority of urban miles; suburban penetration |
| 2038 | 68.0% | Near-saturation of addressable market |
| 2040 | 70.0% | Mature equilibrium |

**The 70% Ceiling:**
- Some trips remain private-vehicle (rural areas, specialized needs)
- Some trips are replaced by public transit, walking, cycling
- The remaining 30% represents the "non-addressable" market

**Total VMT Expansion:**
By 2040, total Western VMT exceeds current baselines due to "induced demand":
- Elderly, children, and disabled gain independent mobility
- Low prices encourage more frequent trips
- Empty "positioning" miles (deadheading) add to total

#### Alternative Views

| View | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Sticky Car Ownership | Bear: 40–50% ceiling | Consumer habits and preferences prove more durable than modeled |
| Public Transit Competition | Bear: -5–10% in urban | Transit competes effectively at $0.45/mile in dense cities |
| Safety Incident Backlash | Bear: 2–5 year delay | Major incidents trigger regulatory slowdown |
| Recession Impact | Bear: 1–3 year delay | Economic cycles slow fleet expansion and adoption |

---

### A.9 P/E Multiple Compression (60x → 15x)

#### Model Assumptions
Valuation multiples compress as the business matures:

| Year | P/E | Rationale |
|------|-----|-----------|
| 2026 | 60x | High-growth tech disruptor; market prices future potential |
| 2029 | 25x | Growth materializing; still significant upside |
| 2032 | 18x | Peak earnings visible; terminal rate becoming clear |
| 2035 | 15x | Utility-like stability; cash cow phase |
| 2038 | 15x | Mature industry; predictable cash flows |
| 2040 | 15x | Industrial/utility giant valuation |

**The NPV-Smoothing Logic:**
Institutional investors looking at total Net Present Value (NPV) of multi-decade cash flow smooth their valuation multiples. The outsized profits of the 2030s are a finite "harvest" before commoditization—investors discount this back rather than applying hype-era multiples.

**The 15x Maturity Multiple:**
Aligned with industrial/utility giants (Union Pacific, modern energy conglomerates). At maturity, Tesla behaves like a stable dividend-payer with predictable earnings.

#### Alternative Views

| View | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Innovation Premium | Bull: 20–25x terminal | Optimus/energy leadership maintains growth multiple |
| Retail Enthusiasm | Bull: 25–40x sustained | Market irrationality extends high multiples beyond fundamentals |
| Growth Reinvestment | Bull: 18–22x terminal | Cash deployed into new ventures vs buybacks sustains growth multiple |
| Execution Skepticism | Bear: 15–20x peak | Doubts about delivery keep multiples lower during growth phase |

---

### A.10 Retained Earnings Calculation

#### Model Assumptions
Cumulative earnings starting from $40B in early 2026:

| Year | Annual Earnings | Cumulative Retained |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 2026 | -$0.4B | $39.6B |
| 2027 | ~$30B | ~$70B |
| 2028 | ~$75B | ~$145B |
| 2029 | $149.7B | $295B |
| 2030 | ~$250B | ~$545B |
| 2031 | ~$320B | ~$865B |
| 2032 | $391.7B | $1,215B |
| 2033 | ~$400B | ~$1,615B |
| 2034 | ~$405B | ~$2,020B |
| 2035 | $406.1B | $2,430B |
| 2036 | ~$350B | ~$2,780B |
| 2037 | ~$280B | ~$3,060B |
| 2038 | $232.3B | $3,290B |
| 2039 | ~$195B | ~$3,485B |
| 2040 | $161B | $3,680B |

**The Cash Fortress:**
By 2040, Tesla holds ~$3.68 Trillion in cash—the largest cash reserve in human history.

**Capital Allocation Reality:**
In practice, Tesla would return much of this to shareholders via buybacks or dividends. If they used that $3.6T to buy back half their shares, the stock price would continue rising even as total Market Cap stabilized.

#### Alternative Views

| View | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Transformative M&A | Bull: Profile change | $3T+ war chest funds acquisitions that reshape company entirely |
| Growth Reinvestment | Bull: Higher multiple | Earnings deployed into Optimus/energy/space vs cash accumulation |
| Shareholder Pressure | Neutral: Earlier returns | Investors demand buybacks/dividends before $3T+ accumulation |
| Windfall Taxation | Bear: -20–40% retained | Regulatory/tax actions reduce earnings accumulation |

---

### A.11 Comparison to Institutional Analysts

#### Model Assumptions
This model aligns with "bull-case" institutional frameworks but is more aggressive than consensus:

| Metric | This Model (2029) | ARK Invest Bull Case | Morgan Stanley Base Case |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Fleet Size | 3.15M vehicles | ~1,000–1,500 launching "full-scale" | ~1,000 vehicles (2026) |
| Pricing | $1.20/mile | $0.59–$0.99/mile | Higher (not specified) |
| Profit Margin | 55% | ~50% EBITDA | Cautious |
| Utilization | 72,000 miles/yr | 46,800–100,000 miles/yr | Variable |

**Model Positioning:**
- More aggressive than Morgan Stanley's conservative view
- Aligned with ARK's optimism on Tesla's structural advantages
- Accounts for "software activation" of existing fleet (a key differentiator)

#### Alternative Views

| View | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Black Swan Event | Bear: Model invalid | Safety incidents or competitive breakthroughs invalidate thesis |
| Consensus Correct | Bear: 1M fleet by 2035 | Morgan Stanley's slower regulatory timeline proves accurate |
| ARK Timeline Optimism | Bear: 2–3 year delay | ARK's historical pattern of over-optimistic timelines repeats |
| Tesla Execution Pattern | Bear: 1–2 year delay | Cybertruck/Semi/FSD delay pattern continues |

---

### A.12 The Nvidia "Android" Factor

#### Model Assumptions
Nvidia positions itself as the "Intel Inside" for legacy automakers:

**Nvidia's Strategy:**
- Drive Orin/Thor chipsets provide a complete self-driving stack
- A legacy OEM can integrate Nvidia and launch a robotaxi for ~$30,000 (vs. Waymo's $150,000+)
- Because Nvidia owns the GPU clusters (H100/B200), they can train driving models faster than anyone except Tesla
- The "Omniverse" simulation allows billions of virtual miles to catch up to Tesla's real-world data

**The "Android" vs. "Apple" Model:**
- Tesla is Apple (closed, integrated)
- Nvidia is Android (open to all)
- This allows the "Nvidia-powered" fleet to scale across multiple brands simultaneously

**The Threat:**
By 2036–2040, the Nvidia Bloc may match Tesla's volume collectively, even if no single OEM does individually.

#### Alternative Views

| View | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Tesla Data Moat | Bull: 2–4 year lead | Billions of real-world miles prove insurmountable advantage |
| OEM Integration Failures | Bull: 1–3 year Nvidia delay | Legacy automakers struggle with software integration |
| Nvidia License Burden | Bull: OEMs at 5–8% margin | License fees limit OEM ability to compete on price |
| Waymo Premium Niche | Neutral: 10–15% share | Safety record and brand trust sustain premium pricing |

---

### A.13 Alternative Factors: What This Model Excludes

This model focuses exclusively on the Western robotaxi business. The following significant factors are deliberately excluded but could materially impact Tesla's total valuation:

| Factor | Potential Impact | Rationale for Exclusion |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Optimus Humanoid Robot** | Bull: $5T+ market by 2040 | Separate business line; timeline highly uncertain |
| **Energy/Supercharger Business** | Bull: $200B–$500B value | Already embedded in 2026 baseline; excludes growth |
| **Eastern Markets (China/APAC)** | Bull: 2x global TAM | Protectionist barriers; separate competitive dynamics |
| **FSD Licensing Revenue** | Bull: $50B–$200B/yr | Low probability; Tesla unlikely to license core advantage |
| **Tesla Insurance** | Bull: $100B–$300B value | Ancillary business; margin compressed by competition |
| **Data Monetization** | Bull: $20B–$100B/yr | Regulatory constraints; unclear business model |
| **Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)** | Bull: $10B–$50B/yr | Technology immature; regulatory/utility integration needed |
| **Used Robotaxi Secondary Market** | Bear: Depresses fleet value | 1M-mile lifespan limits resale; mostly scrap value |
| **Infrastructure Capex** | Bear: -$50B–$200B | Charging stations, service centers, remote ops centers |
| **Platform/App Ecosystem** | Bull: $5B–$20B/yr | In-car purchases, entertainment, productivity apps |
| **Delivery/Logistics Services** | Bull: $100B–$500B | Competes with Amazon/Zoox; requires different vehicle design |
| **Climate Change Impacts** | Mixed | Extreme weather affects utilization; policy incentives help adoption |
| **Demographic Shifts** | Bull: Aging population | Elderly mobility increases TAM; modeled as "induced demand" |
| **Real Estate Holdings** | Bull: $50B–$150B | Charging/service locations; long-term appreciation |
| **Regulatory Credits** | Bear: -$2B–$5B/yr decline | Phasing out as EVs become mainstream |

**Why These Exclusions Matter:**

1. **Optimus Alone Could Exceed Robotaxi Value:** If Tesla solves humanoid robotics at scale, the $6T 2040 Market Cap could be conservative by an order of magnitude.

2. **Energy Business is Real:** The 2026 baseline (~$760B) includes some energy value, but excludes the potential for Tesla to become the dominant grid-scale storage provider.

3. **China is 50% of Global Market:** By excluding Eastern markets, this model covers only half the global robotaxi opportunity.

4. **Cumulative Impact:** These factors could add (or subtract) trillions in value. The model is intentionally conservative by focusing only on the core Western robotaxi thesis.

### A.14 Model Critique: Scenario Analysis

This section provides a critical assessment of both the Normal and Bull case assumptions, identifying where they may be aggressive vs. conservative.

#### Scenario Summary

| Metric | Normal Case | Bull Case | Key Differentiator |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Fleet (2029) | 0.5M | 3.15M | Regulatory approval pace |
| Fleet (2040) | 25M | 33M | Market saturation timing |
| Utilization | 50k mi/yr | 72k mi/yr | Geographic mix (suburban vs urban) |
| Peak Earnings | $137B (2035) | $406B (2035) | Fleet size × utilization |
| Market Penetration (2040) | 45% | 71% | TAM expansion adoption |
| Peak Market Cap | $3.56T (2035) | $9.41T (2035) | Earnings × multiple |
| Terminal Market Cap | $3.37T | $7.06T | Retained earnings accumulation |

#### Internal Consistency

Both scenarios are mathematically consistent. For example:

**Normal Case (2029):** 0.5M vehicles × 50k miles × $1.20/mi = $30B revenue ✓  
**Bull Case (2029):** 3.15M vehicles × 72k miles × $1.20/mi = $272B revenue ✓

The models are logically coherent. The question is whether the *inputs* are realistic.

#### Normal Case: Conservative or Realistic?

| Assumption | Normal Value | Assessment | Rationale |
|------------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| 0.5M fleet by 2029 | 12.5x from 40k | 🟢 Conservative | Allows for regulatory delays, HW3 exclusion |
| 50k mi/yr utilization | 137 mi/day | 🟢 Conservative | Accounts for suburban/rural mix, charging |
| 45% market penetration | By 2040 | 🟡 Moderate | Could be conservative given TAM expansion |
| 32% existing VMT + 13% new TAM | By 2040 | 🟡 Moderate | New TAM thesis is speculative but reasonable |
| $84B terminal earnings | 15% margin | 🟢 Conservative | Mature utility-like margins |

**Normal Case Verdict:** Represents a "things go reasonably well" scenario with buffer for delays and competition.

#### Bull Case: Aggressive Assumptions

| Assumption | Bull Value | Reality Check | Concern Level | Model Counterargument |
|------------|------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| 55% net margin (2029) | $150B on $272B | Apple peaks at ~25% net margin. Saudi Aramco at ~30%. Would be highest margin at scale in history | 🔴 Very High | Tesla undercuts existing transport by 2/3. Price is set by supply/demand, not cost-plus. Early monopoly pricing forces extreme margins until competition arrives |
| 71% market penetration | By 2040 | Assumes near-complete replacement of car ownership + massive new TAM | 🔴 Very High | 50% replacement + 21% new TAM from non-car-owners (young/old/disabled/drunk/tourists/public transit users). Robotaxis expand the market, not just replace it |
| Fleet ramp (57k→3.15M) | 3 years (55x) | Requires mass regulatory approval + HW3/HW4 working perfectly | 🟠 High | Normal case (12.5x) provides downside; Bull assumes Tesla's stated timeline |
| Constant 72k mi/yr | All years, all markets | NYC taxi benchmark applied everywhere | 🟠 High | Normal case (50k) accounts for geographic variation |

#### Earnings Reality Check

| Year | Normal Earnings | Bull Earnings | Context |
|------|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| 2029 | $16.5B | $150B | Normal = large tech company; Bull = most profitable ever |
| 2032 | $85B | $392B | Normal = Aramco-tier; Bull = 4x Aramco peak |
| 2035 | $137B | $406B | Normal = exceptional; Bull = unprecedented |

**Bull Case** requires *everything* to go right: regulatory, technology, competition, adoption, pricing.
**Normal Case** allows for some things to go wrong while still achieving extraordinary outcomes.

#### Potentially Conservative Assumptions (Both Cases)

| Assumption | Model Value | Upside Alternative | Rationale |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Western-only scope | 0% China | Tesla cracks China = 2x TAM | Model assumes protectionist symmetry |
| Excludes Optimus | $0 | Could exceed robotaxi value | Too speculative to model |
| 15x terminal multiple | Both cases | 20-25x if innovation continues | Conservative utility-like valuation |
| $0.45 price floor | Fixed | Battery improvements → $0.35 | Model ends at 2040; further price decline possible |
| New TAM (13-21%) | Moderate | Could be 30%+ of VMT | Mobility for elderly/disabled/young may be underestimated |

#### Key Uncertainties by Impact

**High Impact, High Uncertainty:**
1. **Regulatory timeline** — One fatal accident = multi-year setback (affects Bull more than Normal)
2. **HW3/HW4 capability** — Can existing hardware achieve L4? (Normal assumes some exclusion)
3. **Consumer trust** — Will people get in a driverless car at scale?

**High Impact, Medium Uncertainty:**
4. **Nvidia Bloc timing** — When do Mercedes/Hyundai ship at scale?
5. **Price competition** — How fast does the race to $0.50/mi happen?

**Medium Impact, High Uncertainty:**
6. **Owner opt-in rates** — Will consumers put their cars on the network?
7. **Insurance/liability** — Who pays when there's an accident?
8. **New TAM realization** — Will non-car-owners actually adopt robotaxis at scale?

#### Assessment Summary

**Bull Case** represents "everything goes right":
- Regulatory approval on Tesla's timeline ✓
- HW3/HW4 works for unsupervised driving ✓
- Competition is 3-5 years behind ✓
- Consumers adopt rapidly ✓
- Pricing power persists through 2032 ✓
- New TAM fully materializes ✓

**Normal Case** represents "things go reasonably well":
- Some regulatory delays tolerated
- Some HW3 vehicles excluded
- Competition arrives on schedule
- Consumer adoption is gradual
- Price compression happens earlier
- Partial new TAM realization

| Scenario | 2035 Peak | 2040 Terminal | Probability Assessment |
|----------|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Bull** | $9.4T | $7.1T | ~20% (everything works) |
| **Normal** | $3.6T | $3.4T | ~50% (reasonable execution) |
| **Bear** (not modeled) | ~$1.5T | ~$1.2T | ~30% (significant setbacks) |

**Key Insight:** Even the Normal case produces a **$3.4T market cap** by 2040—roughly **4x current valuation**. The question isn't whether robotaxis create value, but *how much*.

## 5. Key Risks and Sensitivities

### 5.1 Regulatory Risk
The model assumes progressive regulatory approval. A major safety incident could trigger backlash, slowing deployment by years.

### 5.2 Technology Risk
FSD must achieve and maintain superhuman safety metrics. Any regression could halt deployments.

### 5.3 Competitive Risk
Faster-than-expected scaling by Nvidia Bloc or Waymo could compress margins earlier.

### 5.4 Macroeconomic Risk
Recessions could slow fleet expansion and consumer adoption.

### 5.5 Geopolitical Risk
Trade tensions, data security laws, or protectionist policies could reshape market access.

---

## 6. Conclusion

This model presents two scenarios for Tesla's robotaxi opportunity in Western markets:

### Normal Case Summary
| Milestone | Value | Timing |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Peak Market Cap | **$3.56T** | 2035 |
| Peak Earnings | $137B/yr | 2035 |
| Terminal Market Cap | **$3.37T** | 2040 |
| Terminal Earnings | $84B/yr | 2040 |
| Retained Earnings | $1.1T | 2040 |

### Bull Case Summary
| Milestone | Value | Timing |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Peak Market Cap | **$9.41T** | 2035 |
| Peak Earnings | $406B/yr | 2035 |
| Terminal Market Cap | **$7.06T** | 2040 |
| Terminal Earnings | $161B/yr | 2040 |
| Retained Earnings | $3.6T | 2040 |

### Key Takeaways

1. **The "Harvest Window" (2029–2035)** is critical in both scenarios—this is when Tesla's first-mover advantage generates maximum value before competition matures.

2. **Market Penetration Drivers:**
   - **Existing VMT replacement:** 32% (Normal) to 50% (Bull) of current car miles
   - **New TAM (non-car-owners):** 13% (Normal) to 21% (Bull) additional miles from young/old/disabled/drunk/tourists/public transit users

3. **The Core Thesis:** Tesla's structural cost advantage ($0.20/mile vs. competitors' $0.35–$0.45/mile) enables it to thrive at price points where competitors merely survive.

4. **Even the Normal Case is Extraordinary:** $3.4T by 2040 represents ~4x current valuation, with $1.1T in accumulated cash.

5. **Key Differentiators Between Scenarios:**
   - Fleet ramp speed (regulatory approval pace)
   - Utilization rates (geographic mix)
   - New TAM realization (non-car-owner adoption)

6. **Key Uncertainties:** Regulatory timeline, HW3 fleet activation capability, Nvidia Bloc scaling speed, and consumer trust in autonomous vehicles.
